NZPUG Reportlab Demo Files
==========================

This is a collection of short demonstrations to show off the key
features of the Reportlab PDF authoring library for new users.

The idea was for these files to make
up a set of self-documenting notes for a talk which I
presented to the Wellington meeting of the New Zealand Python User Group
on 8 August 2011.

Dependencies
  - Reportlab Toolkit 2.5
